 Ahoy, matey! This be the chest holdin' the configuration files fer the **Cleanuperr** service. These scrolls be mounted into the Cleanuperr container as the service config directory, helpin' ye keep yer ship's hold free of cursed cargo.

## Purpose 🌊

 Cleanuperr be yer diligent deckhand, automatin' the cleanup of unwanted or blocked files from Sonarr, Radarr, and yer trusty download mates like qBittorrent. It scours the decks for incomplete or blocked downloads, clears out malicious or troublesome booty like `*.lnk` or `*.zipx` files, and enforces blacklists or whitelists to keep yer haul pristine. Once the foul cargo be cast overboard, Cleanuperr can even chart a new course and trigger a search to replace what was lost.
