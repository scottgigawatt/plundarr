# Overseerr Configuration Directory

This directory holds the configuration files for the Overseerr service.

When the Plundarr Docker stack is started, this directory will be mounted into the Overseerr container to store and manage its settings.

For more information on how this fits into the full Plundarr setup, see the main [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) file.

Arrr, set your sails and configure wisely!
