# Plundarr Docker Setup Guide ⚓🐳🏴‍☠️

Avast ye! This here be the guide for riggin' up yer Docker Compose fleet. It covers the treacherous waters of Synology DiskStations with DSM 7.2 or later, but landlubbers usin' Linux and macOS can sail by these charts too! 🏴‍☠️

## Chartin' the Docker Network Waters 🌍🧭

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚓️ Set yer IPAM settings right in yer `.env` before settin' sail, or ye'll find yerself adrift in a sea of network woes!

Docker IPAM (IP Address Management) lets ye carve out yer own slice of the subnet seas, makin' yer fleet easier to command and troubleshoot 🛠️.

Update these settings in your `.env` file:

```bash
#
# Broad waters fer the subnet (Subnet range: 172.28.0.1 - 172.28.255.254)
# Chart mask: 255.255.0.0
#
COMPOSE_NETWORK_SUBNET="${COMPOSE_NETWORK_SUBNET:-172.28.0.0/16}"

#
# Where the crew drops anchor (IP range fer containers: 172.28.5.1 - 172.28.5.254)
# Chart mask: 255.255.255.0
#
COMPOSE_NETWORK_IP_RANGE="${COMPOSE_NETWORK_IP_RANGE:-172.28.5.0/24}"

#
# Gateway to the open seas (Network gateway IP address)
#
COMPOSE_NETWORK_GATEWAY="${COMPOSE_NETWORK_GATEWAY:-172.28.5.254}"
```

For detailed documentation, refer to the [Docker Compose IPAM documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/06-networks/#ipam).

## Batten Down the Hatches 🖥️⚓

Fer them sailin' with Synology DiskStations, here be the riggin' details ye need!

### Guardin' the Ship 🔥🛡️

> [!WARNING]
> 🏴‍☠️ Misfirin' yer firewall could leave yer crew stranded! Double-check them source IPs and subnet details before ye weigh anchor.

If your Synology DiskStation firewall is enabled, allow traffic for the custom Docker network:

1. 🛠️ Open **Control Panel** → **Security** (under Connectivity).
2. 🛡️ Go to the **Firewall** tab → Click **Edit Rules**.
3. ➕ Click **Create** to add a rule:
   - 🎯 **Ports**: Select `All`
   - 🌐 **Source IP**: Select `Specific IP`
   - 🧩 Click `Select` → Choose `Subnet`
   - 📝 Enter `172.28.0.0` for **IP Address** and `255.255.0.0` for **Subnet mask/Prefix length**
   - ✅ **Action**: Select `Allow`
4. 💾 Click **OK** to apply.

This allows containers to communicate internally within the defined Docker network.

### Launchin' Yer Fleet 📦🚀

> [!NOTE]
> 📜 If yer on DSM 7.2 or later, Synology's Container Manager Project be the swiftest way to get yer fleet underway. Make sure yer vessel's firmware be up-to-date!

To deploy a project using Synology Container Manager:

1. 🔑 Log in to the Synology DSM web interface.
2. 📦 Open **Container Manager** and navigate to the **Project** tab 📂.
3. 🆕 Click **Create** and configure:
   - 🏷️ **Project Name**: (e.g., `plundarr`)
   - 📂 **Project Path**: Path to the cloned repository.
4. 🚀 Review and confirm the settings to deploy the project.

Refer to the [official Synology documentation](https://kb.synology.com/en-id/DSM/help/ContainerManager/docker_project?version=7) for further details.

These secrets should have ye sailin' smooth seas 🚢 — may yer containers stay hearty 🏴‍☠️ and yer logs whisper like the calm before a storm 🌊. Fair winds and followin' seas, matey! 🐳🏴‍☠️
